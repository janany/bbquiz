r.js is currently at version 2.0.2 because higher versions do not ignore the second require.config
in common-configs.js

There is also an issue with 2.0.2 when namespacing the jquery file, so it has been modified. The 
regex they were using was expecting jquery to not be minified, and fails to properly replace
values when using the minified version.
